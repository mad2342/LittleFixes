# Little Things

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Fix some little annoyances and change minor things.

## Fixes
- Bonuses display for Equipment had a missing comma added
- Fixed wrong getters for Resolve/Turn
- Replace hardcoded(!) tooltip descriptions for morale levels
    - Now the values are read from "BaselineAddFromSimGameValues" in CombatGameConstants.json
- Pilots health is now correctly displayed in Barracks and Hiring Halls

## Changes/Additions
- Enable Reserving for AI
    - Adjustable base chance
    - No behaviour variables tweaked (You want "BetterAI")
- DFA attacks remove entrenched state from enemy Mechs
